# Download High-Resolution Images from Artsy.com

First, set up the dependencies. This requires a C compiler because of PIL.

```python
make env
```

Then, run the download script. Paste in [any artsy image URL, like this
one](http://artsy.net/artwork/johannes-vermeer-view-of-delft-netherlands-after-the-fire).

```python
make download
```

Done!
